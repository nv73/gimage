# gimage
Application for the classification of multi-band rasters. 

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Load the environment file geoCanvas.yml if you want to avoid having to install the dependencies manually.

Add a new environment variable to point to GDAL, for example:

  C:\Users\user.name\Anaconda3\envs\geocanvas\Lib\site-packages\osgeo
  
This should now work(?)
